Bulletin boards are the forum of inter-player communication on the MUD.
There are different bulletin boards for different purposes -- for example,
a standard mortal board, a board for immortals, a board for fun "social"
messages, etc.  Naturally, not all players may be allowed to read all
types of boards.

Type "LOOK BOARD" to see the messages already posted on a board.  Type
"WRITE <subject>" to post a message to a board; terminate a message with
a '@' as the first character on a line.  Type "READ <number>" to read a
post.  Type "REMOVE <number>" to remove your own messages.

Example:

  > look at board
  > write Am I using these boards correctly?
  [writes the message; terminates with a '@']
  > look at board
  > read 6
  > remove 6
